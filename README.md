- **About** shows more details about the developer.
- **Projects** will showcase the list of cards where each card is represented with an `Image`, `Title`, `Text` along with the links to the project, source code/
- **`Loading...`** will be shown while fetching the projects, **`There was an error`** if any error has occurred.
- Data is handled by the headless CMS **`Contentful`** SDK, **`data.jsx`** and styles are implemented using by **`Tailwind CSS`**.
